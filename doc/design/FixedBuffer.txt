Design of FixedBuffer
=====================
Author: Bela Ban
Date:   April 2024


FixedBuffer is a class used by NAKACK4 [1] to deliver messages in correct order and repair lost messages.

There is one ring buffer per member.

Messages are added to the buffer by a sender, when sending a message, and by receivers when receiving a message.
The messages are removed as long as there are no gaps (= missing messages), and delivered to the application.

FixedBuffer is implemented as a (fixed capacity) array with wrap-around. Seqnos are mapped to an array index by a
function similar to 'seqno % capacity'.

FixedBuffer has 3 pointers: LOW, HD and HIGH. They are used as follows:

In a send/receive window (used to send messages to everyone and also receive its own (loopback) messages):
* LOW: the highest seqno seen by everyone; incremented when we've received ACKs from every receiver (min of all ACKs).
       This unblocks blocked senders.
* HD: the highest seqno delivered to the application (incremented on removal of loopback messages)
* HIGH: the highest seqno sent/received

In a receive window:
* LOW: - (same as HD)
* HD: the highest seqno delivered to the application (incremented on removal, together with LOW)
* HIGH: the highest seqno received

LOW <= HD <= HIGH always holds.

All 3 pointers point to the same seqno on creation of a FixedBuffer, and are modified as follows:

* Add message M (sender):
  * If M.seqno - LOW > capacity -> drop M or block (depending on parameter)
  * Else:
    * Add M at index(M.seqno) if null, else drop
    * HIGH=max(HIGH,M.seqno)

* Remove a message (receiver):
  * If LOW <= HIGH and index(LOW) != null:
    * Return element at index[LOW] and null index[LOW]
    * LOW=LOW+1
    * Unblock blocked adders
  * Else -> return null

* Purge elements (S: seqno)
  * Null elements in range [index(LOW) .. index(min(S,HIGH)]
  * LOW=min(S,HIGH)
  * Unblock blocked adders
